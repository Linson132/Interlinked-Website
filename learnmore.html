<p>Dr. Phil is giving away big money to a lucky college student each week! The "phrase of the day" is not on the internet. Youâ€™ll only find it on TV and it could pop up anytime during the episode. The more you watch, the more chances you have to win. One grand prize winner will be randomly selected each week.</p>
