<p>In most instances, I am a big advocate for American-made cheeses. Feta is one area where I'm not. While Greek Feta is a PDO (protected designation of origin) cheese, made of a blend of sheep and goat milk, the name "feta" has been co-opted by producers in the U.S. for brined white cheese, typically pre-crumbled in cups. Most of the time, this cheese is 100% cows' milk and bears no resemblance to the savory, sea-salty chunks of fatty, tangy feta commonly eaten throughout the day in Greece.<p>
